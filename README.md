#  Smart Fertilizer Recommendation and Crop Yield Prediction

This project helps **farmers use the right amount of fertilizer** to grow more crops without wasting resources. It uses **machine learning** to predict crop yield based on important environmental and soil factors such as **nutrient levels, pH value, rainfall, and sunlight**. By analyzing these factors, the system provides easy-to-understand fertilizer suggestions that can help **increase yield, reduce cost, and protect the environment**.

The project is built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, making it simple and interactive for users. Farmers or agricultural researchers can input soil and weather details, and the model instantly predicts the expected crop yield and recommends the most suitable type and quantity of fertilizer. The main goal of this project is to support **smart farming practices** through data-driven insights and promote **sustainable agriculture**.

The machine learning model is trained on agricultural datasets that include soil nutrient composition, weather patterns, and crop yield data. The model learns how these features affect productivity and then provides fertilizer recommendations tailored to each situation. Streamlit is used to create an intuitive web-based interface, allowing users to easily interact with the prediction system without needing coding knowledge.

This project demonstrates how **AI and data science** can be applied to improve agricultural efficiency. It not only supports better fertilizer management but also helps in **reducing environmental impact** caused by overuse of chemical fertilizers. Farmers can make better decisions that balance **productivity, sustainability, and profitability**.
